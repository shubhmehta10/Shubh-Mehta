              <p>The project aims to evaluate and optimize the performance of three notable convolutional neural networks 
                (CNNs) — LeNet, AlexNet, and GoogLeNet (Inception V1) — for real-time image classification of road markings. 
                The evaluation focuses on accuracy and inference time using a dataset of 640x640 JPG images with a train/validation/test 
                split of 77%/15%/7%. The team plans to utilize Nvidia’s CUDA toolkit to enhance computation through parallelization. 
                The overarching goals are to identify the most effective CNN architecture for applications like smart cars and to explore 
                how hardware acceleration can boost CNN performance. This comprehensive approach will not only help determine the best CNN 
                but also provide insights into the evolution and potential of CNNs in smart applications, thereby guiding future research.</p>

              <p>The combination of vector databases and Large Language Models (LLMs) is a major development in the fields of information retrieval and 
                natural language processing. In the context of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications, this study examines the cooperative dynamics 
                of cutting-edge LLMs, such as Falcon 7B and Zephyr 7B Beta, and premier vector databases, such as FAISS and ChromaDB. This paper outlines the 
                critical performance factors that impact RAG optimization by careful assessment and comparative analysis, offering insights into the subtleties 
                of retrieval efficiency impacted by GPU memory allocations. The analysis of BGE and OpenAI embeddings highlights the significance that embedding 
                quality plays in RAG applications. This work advances our knowledge of the complementary relationship between vector databases and LLMs and their 
                joint potential to improve information retrieval and natural language generation.</p>

                Technologies Used: Model-Free Reinforcement Learning (MFRL), ROS2, Gazebo, Python, and robotic simulation.</div>
              <p>This project tackles the complex task of controlling a quadruped robot using model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL) within the ROS2 and Gazebo 
                simulation environment. Quadruped robots are versatile but face challenges in adapting to dynamic environments as well as require complex control
                 de- sign to operate robustly in dynamic environments. The integration of ROS2 and Gazebo is crucial, serving as a bridge between simulation and 
                 real-world deployment.
                 <!-- <span id="more-content-1" class="collapse"> -->
                 Our solution combines MFRL with ROS2 and Gazebo, providing an efficient platform for testing and transitioning learned policies 
                 to physical robots. The ROS2 framework ensures streamlined communication, while Gazebo offers a realistic simulation environment. This approach enhances
                  adaptability and autonomy, crucial for applications like search and rescue.The significance lies in mitigating risks associated with direct 
                  experimentation on physical robots. By allowing robots to learn and optimize control policies in simulation, our approach empowers them to adapt to 
                  unforeseen challenges in real-world scenarios. This project introduced an alternative solution for quadruped robot control, addressing challenges 
                  posed by real-world complex- ities and advancing autonomous robotic systems.

                Machine Learning and Forecasting Techniques of Macro and Micro economies of a country</h3>
              <div class="subheading mb-3">Technologies Used: Python, PyTorch, TensorFlow, ARIMA SARIMA, Forecasting Techniques </div>
              <p>This project explores the use of machine learning (ML) techniques for forecasting economic indicators at both the macro and micro levels in a country. 
                Economic forecasting is a critical process for policymakers, businesses, and investors, and ML-based approaches have the potential to improve the accuracy 
                and speed of forecasting. The project also highlights some of the key considerations when applying ML techniques to economic forecasting, including data quality, 
                feature selection, and model interpretability. In economic activity, recessions represent a period of failure in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and usually are 
                presented as episodic and non-linear. For this reason, they are difficult to predict and appear as one of the main problems in macroeconomics forecasts. 
                By taking into consideration several macro and micro economic factors such as employment, domestic demand, credit system, etc we build ML models. Algorithms 
                such as Linear regression, Random Forest, Time Series Analysis, etc are used to conduct economic prediction. The application and subsequent comparison of 
                different machine learning models at different economic levels help us to find which methods are suitable for specific economic predictions.
                Overall, this project demonstrates that ML techniques have the potential to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of economic forecasting 
                and can provide valuable insights for decision-makers in both the public and private sector.</p>

              <p>The era of mobile technology opens the windows to android app development. The websites are getting overshadowed 
                by the advancements in Native APP development. Thus, it is convenient to change from conventional websites to apps, which has 
                become a major part of our daily routine. Considering the easy use and more preference to Android Apps, we are introducing 
                6’ APART APP, an android application that helps in analyzing if people are maintaining Social Distance among themselves while 
                being in a crowded area. Due to the outbreak of Coronavirus, a lot has changed in the world. The new normal will be impossible 
                if citizens do not take necessary precautions like wearing a face mask and maintaining a distance of 6 feet at all times but 
                there will come times when individuals will have to go out for work, use public transport. Police personnel will be able to make 
                sure if citizens are following the rules of Social Distancing, just with the help of this app and thus, they can avoid going on 
                physical patrols. During these situations, 6’ APART APP would be a great tool in helping people also by letting them decide whether 
                or not they should enter a crowded place.</p>
